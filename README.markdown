# EntryPagePrefsFix #

This a **work-in-progress** plugin for Melody and Movable Type designed to monkey patch a fix for [a bug](https://openmelody.lighthouseapp.com/projects/26604/tickets/98-page-and-entry-prefs-clobber-one-another-upon-save) which causes entry and page display prefs to clobber each other.

Follow along if you like, but it's not ready for use yet.
